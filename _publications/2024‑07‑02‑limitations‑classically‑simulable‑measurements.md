In this Letter, we rigorously analyze the limitations of **stabilizer (classically simulable) measurements** in tasks involving quantum state discrimination.  
Key findings include:

- A proof that **pure magic states and their orthogonal complements in odd-prime dimensions cannot be unambiguously distinguished** using only stabilizer measurements, no matter how many copies are available :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1};
- A demonstration of **intrinsic parallels** and **distinct phenomena** between the quantum resource theories of magic states and entanglement, illuminating deeper structural insights in state discrimination :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

This work deepens our understanding of the **quantum-classical boundary** in measurement operations and sets new limits for classically simulable protocols in quantum information theory.
