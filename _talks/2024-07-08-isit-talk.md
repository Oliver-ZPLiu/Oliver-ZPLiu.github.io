This presentation‚Äîdelivered by my co-author‚Äîintroduced our recent results on the **entanglement cost required to discriminate quantum states when operations are restricted by locality constraints**, focusing on:

- Introduction of **spectral PPT-distance** as a lower bound on entanglement cost using PPT POVMs;
- Derivation of **upper bounds**, proving that a single Bell state suffices for optimally discriminating a pure state against any other state;
- Applications in **quantum data hiding**, distributed quantum sensing, and the resource cost of implementing measurements under LOCC constraints.
