This talk—delivered by my co-author—covered our recent work on the **amortized stabilizer Rényi entropy of quantum dynamics**, focusing on:

- A resource-theoretic formulation that quantifies **magic generation** in quantum dynamics;
- Derivation of amortized Rényi entropy measures capturing entanglement-enhanced nonstabilizerness;
- Applications including **lower bounds on T‑count** of quantum circuits and insights for fault-tolerant quantum computing.

**Conference Info**  
The Quantum Resources 2025 workshop took place from **March 17–21, 2025** at **Maison Glad Jeju**, Jeju Island, South Korea. It brought together quantum resource theorists focusing on topics like entanglement, coherence, magic, and resource-efficient computing.
