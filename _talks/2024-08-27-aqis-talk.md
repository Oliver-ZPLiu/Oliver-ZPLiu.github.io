In this talk, I presented our recent work on coherence–distinguishability duality, from a resource-theoretic perspective extending wave-particle duality. This included:

- A formalism comparing **coherent ‘co-bits’** and classical distinguishability (‘c-bits’) in quantum ensembles;
- A proof that the sum of preserved coherence and extracted distinguishability is fundamentally bounded;
- Implications for coherence-preserving quantum state discrimination.
